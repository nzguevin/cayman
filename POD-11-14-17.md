# In Response to "Something is Wrong on the Internet"


I agree with Bridle when he says that the structure of these reward systems leads to the exploitation of them. We can see this in other areas of life as well. If we look at other systems with automated rewards and little regulation, or not strong enough regulation, we see this is the case there as well. One place we can see this is in high level sports and video games. Anywhere where cheating and drugs can enhance performance they have been used to. If there are rewards for those who win at said thing people will cheat. This also shows in the education system a lot of the time. People in traditional education scenarios have shown to cheat in order to get ahead. I know that these are not necessarily as concrete examples of rewards, but I still believe that they apply. I try to be aware of the roles that bots and reward systems play in my life. I think that the number of each is cause for alarm, especially in the context that Bridle addresses. I think that the best way to counter these things is to continue to offer rewards, but to bump up security and measures that make it impossible for automated exploit of said rewards. The other idea is to end the automated reward system entirely and make them either not automated or not reward system. I think that there are times when each of these choices is valuable and times when they are not. For example a lack of a reward system could be very positive in school systems (i.e. Bennington) but also unautomated rewards could too be a very positive change there (grading not based on simply a 100 point system, subjective grading, etc.) In terms of the example provided by Bridle specifically I believe that the best course of action would be to make it a lot harder for these users to exploit the system by making the reward system less automated, or by providing far larger security measures.
