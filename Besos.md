```
[Verse 1]

Black tourmaline and amethyst
Hot damn it, I'm bad at this
Ever find yourself asking where David Mamet is?
```
[David Mamet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mamet) is an American playwright 

```
Probably not, well
I'm convinced that he's my life's narrator
I saw your bare chest and I savored that moment like a Now & Later
```
[Now and Later](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_and_Later) is a type of candy manufactured by Ferrera Candy Company. Coincidentally Ferreira is Milo's last name. 

```
That's a tasty little candy treat
I look down, what dandy feet
I even wrote it in my manuscript
You didn't mind that I'd dine on a Pythagorean diet
```
[Pythagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras) was a philosopher and mathematician that did not believe in eating meat, hence the Pythagorean diet which is referring to vegetarianism.

```
All your friends remind me of Parisian spies
I even sketched your outline in my journal
I might have wrote X loves Z above the urinal
Because I'm twelve years old
And I have a linear understanding of causality
You've only ever been a pal to me
I had that glinty eye like Emperor Palpatine
```
[Emperor Palpatine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpatine) is one of the primary antagonists in the Star Wars series.

```
I'm not going to pretend that I know what pallid means

No filler lines
The number 9 and the number 7
Then I devoured you like a hungry little muskrat
```
Here America's cover of the song [Muskrat Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF3FIrJc6Q) is sampled. 

```
[Verse 2]

Built a shrine by my bed of ascension stones
Then I broke my bones to make these drum loops, oops
I'm a dumb dude and I shouldn't have said that
I was the Egyptian in the meme wearing a bread hat
```
This is a reference to this [meme](http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/97423-bread-helmet-man).

```
I've got these ACME earthquake pills
```
This is a reference to the [ACME Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_Corporation) which appears in many cartoons, but mostly *Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote* and other Looney Toons.

```
Now tell me about your world views
In the dark I felt you sneeze and your form took shape like Meadowlark
I think you're really pretty and I hardly ever mean that
My form is more conducive to a beanbag
Sometimes it feels like we're Abraham and Sarah
```
This is a reference to the old testament story of [Abraham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham) and [Sarah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah).

```
I don't have a theory of sex
Everyone else is king of Abimelech
Perhaps I'm more like Richard Dedekind
```
[Richard Dedekind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dedekind) was a German mathematician who was important to abstract algebra, axiomatic foundation for the natural numbers, algebraic number theory and the definition of the real numbers.

```
I don't mean to let all these abstractions in
I don't mean to carry on about your form
I don't mean to surf internet forums for porn
Georg Cantor, I enjoy your banter
```
[Georg Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor) was a German mathematician who invented set theory. 

```
I think we could develop a theory of the infinite
Or transfinite
I thought I'd dedicated my life to mining pyrite
Now we store supper in Pyrex containers in the fridge
When I'm around you I let my hair down
```
