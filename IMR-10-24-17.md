# Ideas from Readings

One idea that I latched onto very quickly is from Neil Postman's [Five Things We Need to Know About Technological Change](http://worrydream.com/refs/Postman%20-%20Five%20Things%20We%20Need%20to%20Know%20About%20Technological%20Change.pdf). It was the fifth idea he presented being that much of the things that we use in every day life tend to become "mythic" in that we get so used to them that we no longer quesiton the origins of them. The example he used was the alphabet. He said he asked his students if any of them knew when the alphabet was invented. This is an interesting question, and one I never really thought about. Of course the alphabet was invented, just as language was, but you never really think of when. Additionally our alphabet is sort of evolutionary, not entirely new. Apparently the Modern English alphabet was produced for the first time sometime around the mid 16th century. One could argue that the English alphabet existed before that, however, especailly since the change from Middle English to Modern English only really was the seperation of the characters 'U' and 'V', making 'U' the vowel and 'V' the consenant. Alphabetic writing, however, was developed between 1900 and 1800 BC. These are things I have never really thought about. It is pretty wild to think that there has been written language for 4000 years at this point. It is also wild to think about a time where written language simply did not exist. Thinking of spoken language without written is very confusing to me. I guess it only makes sense that languages exist as spoken before written, but it seems backwards for some reason. 

The real point here, however, is not about language or alphabets, but how we perceive technology. I think one of the reasons I have been so interested in computer science is for this exact reason. The idea that all of these things exist that we use on a daily basis, but so few of us know how they work. I strive to know how they work inside and out. I have a long way to go before I actually do, but I do not want these objects to become mythic. I want to understand how to make them and how they do what they do. I also, going back to the first point Postman made, want to understand the negative aspects to each piece of technology. I think the points that Postman raises are important for everyone to read and know about. I felt as though some of them were obvious in the scope of technology, however realizing what has happened with the alphabet made me understand that in the future none of this will be obvious. Computers will be absolutely mythic. They will have exised for long enough to no longer be questioned. Just fully accepted.
