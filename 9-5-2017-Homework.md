# [](#header-1)On _The Internet With A Human Face_ and 9/4 Class

Reading _The Internet With A Human Face_ was not exactly cheery, although it did provide so much information to me, and broadened how I think about the Internet and our use of it. I have been thinking a lot about data lately and how it is used. Where it comes from, what it is used for, the lengths people go to to collect it. This thinking has leaked into my other classes and interests. In a different class while talking about IQ, I realized the uses of that data, and how well one could market to certain individuals based on their IQ tests. 

Another use of data that was introduced to me recently was the idea of calculating Social Security numbers. They are almost exactly calculabe if you know certain information about a person. This led to me thinking about what information specifically you need. Time and location of birth seem to be all that one would need to calculate a social security number. [This article](https://arstechnica.com/science/2009/07/social-insecurity-numbers-open-to-hacking/) talks about an algorithm that was founded at Carnegie Mellon that allows for nearly perfect calculation of Social Security numbers. Now the question comes, where is that data available?

Well one location that commonly recieves that data is astrology websites. To get an full star chart one must input their time and location of birth, but what if these websites are calculating more than just a star chart. These websites could be saving this data on the user and either selling it or making use of it themselves. If this is the case, and if the algorithm is perfected it could lead to identity theft quite easily. Require the person who is asking for their star chart to enter their real first and last name as well, and then one could go about stealing that persons identity. Of course it would only work knowing that people would tell the truth, and if the algorithm was more accurate, but nonetheless this concept is incredibly frightening.
