# On Mozilla's 'Internet Health Report'

I am not sure that I believe in a healthy Internet. This may just be me being jaded about the current state of the web, but I do not believe we can exist in a time where the Internet is used in a way that it benefits all. If the health is based on every individual user this makes it so it cannot be healthy. I do believe that it can be healthier than it is, however not actually healthy. I also think that it is strange that Mozilla is who is leading this conversation. The first time I read through this I could not stop asking myself "What do they have to gain from this?" Mozilla as a corporation that profits off of Internet usage is not necessarily the best representative of the argument that there is something wrong with the Internet. Again this may just come from me being jaded however. Frankly as a company whose products I have always prefered over others, I did feel a slight sense of pride that they were the ones who started this discussion. Maybe they are not scummy after all, and truly believe in the change that needs to occur for the Internet to benefit more. Maybe, however, they are meerly looking for more costumers worldwide, and are trying to push the idea of their browser to a wider audience. 

The piece of this report that stood out to me the most actually came in one of the data visuals under the 'digital inclusion' tab. It was the piece that spoke about the percentage of the Internet that existed in certain languages versus the perentage of users who spoke said language. The statistic that they present as the very striking one is that 19.8% of the users on the Internet speak Chinese, however only 2% of web content are in Chinese. The statistic that really rattled me, though, was that 25.3% of Internet users speak English, but over half of web content is in English. This is a clear cut example of how the Internet is not inclusive and drives people away.
