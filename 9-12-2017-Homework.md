# [](#header-1)What Google searches say about us

I do believe that our Google searches say quite a lot about who we are, however as with anything they do not tell the whole story. I think that a lot of information about a human can be pulled from any history of theirs, including that on the internet. This article raises some very interesting points about searches that people would not want to get out. One thing that I am interested in is if these statistics take into account incognito and private searches, although it would only make sense for them to. I find this data analysis very interesting. I find that all of these things are very important to know and are not things one would immediately assume, especially if they are someone who tries to think the best of those around them. 

One topic I would be really interested in is how many of these people project these feelings in everyday life outside of the internet. How many of these bigots who are searching for insensitive jokes actually present themselves as bigots to their peers and how many keep their bigotry to online usage? Does the aspect of anonymity add to these people's bigotry in a drastic way? 

Additionally, while this is all incredibly interesting to me, the information we have read so far has been so dark and scary. I understand that this is all the truth and that all this data exists, but I sincerely hope that we as human beings start to improve, and that data starts to be used for more positive reasons and less money grabbing.
