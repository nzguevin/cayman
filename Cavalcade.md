> "In February, my family had (what we thought to be) a cancer scare with my Grandfather. There were sudden, dramatic, startling signs that came entirely out of 'nowhere,' insofar as we were all ignorant of the day-to-day life of this old fellow we all look up to and admire. Unmoored by the potential loss of our family's patriarch, I watched as my mother, uncle, et al, began to slowly unravel. My Grandfather, like most of those in the category, possesses a sort of dreamlike emperor-title and provides my clan with our moral, spiritual, and philosophical guidance. He is the village sage â€” the man with impeccable sight who is capable of staring into the abyss. This was my attempt at an ode. His favorite band is America. Each song on this tape finds inspiration from that starting point." -Milo
