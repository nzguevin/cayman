# Geometry and Theology

Background sample: [A Horse With No Name - America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAJ0l4OBHM)

Title Reference: ["A Confederacy of Dunces" - John Kennedy Toole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Confederacy_of_Dunces)

The protagonist of the story, Ignatius Reilly, often will refer to the modern world as lacking "theology and geometry" - hence the title of this song. 

```
[Ludwig Wittgenstein]

A dog cannot lie, neither can he be sincere
A dog may be expecting his master to come
Why can't he be expecting him to come next Wednesday?
Is it because he doesn't have language?
If a lion could speak, we would not be able to understand what he said
Why do I say such a thing?

[Students]

"If we could understand him, I shouldn't think we'd have too much trouble with a lion.."
"We could get an interpreter."

[Wittgenstein]

Do you mean for me or for the lion?
Yes, yes, w-we could get an interpreter
What possible use could that be?
To imagine a language is to imagine a form of life
It's what we do and who we are that gives meaning to our words
I can't understand a lion's language because I don't know what his world is like!
How can I know the world a lion inhabits?!
```

This introduction comes from the film [*Wittgenstein* by Derek Jarman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wittgenstein_(film)) - a film about the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. The ideas quoted in the scene sampled in this song come from Wittgenstein's work titled "Philosophical Investigations". 

```
[Verse 1]

Boiled the elements down into the axioms
Mistook a fax for remedial tediums
It seems Ezekiel speaks to some
```
This is a reference to the poetry by [Nissim Ezekiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissim_Ezekiel).

```
My mind was hazy and numb
And left hand gripped a clump of palladium
Saw the beast with the wings and the talons
The simple answer but it felt out of balance
Bad news like a blue screen of death
```

This is a reference to the [error screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Screen_of_Death) shown when a PC dies.

```
Besides the point, but which hue seems best?
Blessed
With every album my head grows bigger
It's beyond my nigga love each girl on twitter
Nonetheless, I nominate myself as tribute
Should the submarine flood, we would surely be fish food
I can seem to speak around it
If I could only hit the nail on the head
I'll read this fan mail when I'm dead
It's time to enlist in the service
It's time to struggle with purpose
For too long I've been the opposite of sanguine
```

This is a reference to [Milo's *Sanguine Spin Cycles*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4_wZxf2WiI), a song released on his first project.

```
It's time to analyze the language

I think I got god's answering machine... again

I wanna growl right here

I felt it in my bones, deep from the grave
I haven't seen it yet, but I'll know it on a day

[America]

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can't remember your name
Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La la...
```

This is also sampled from [A Horse With No Name by America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAJ0l4OBHM). This sample was used as it is Milo's grandfather's favorite band, and Milo thought at the creation of this album that his grandfather was going to pass from cancer. 

```
[Verse 2]

I'll keep conducting these autistic symphonies
These sentences have sentenced me
Like I didn't have the sense to sense the mere
The presence grows weird
Doesn't make sense but I don't fear, not a damn thing

I live like a man who's already dead
Like I had a motorcycle but my name is Zed
```

This is a reference to the movie [*Pulp Fiction* by Quentin Tarantino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_Fiction) specifically this [scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lL1ypndnWA) where Bruce Willis' character Butch steals a motorcycle from someone named Zed who he has earlier killed, announcing "Zed's dead baby, Zed's dead" as he drives away.

```
(I'll be missed), said another clumsy alchemist

Like he just learned predicate calculus
The existential quantifier, a backwards EX
```

This is a reference to the symbol [Turned E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ÆŽ) which represents [existential quantification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_quantification) in predicate logic. When followed by an X it is called an existential quantifier. It is used to mean "there exists".

My rap career is a cataloging of defects

Like he must be new to this
Milo doesn't exude hubris, chuuch
Like he must be new to this
Milo doesn't exude hubris

[Al Swearengen as played by Ian McShane]

Pain or damage don't end the world
Or despair, or fucking beatings
The world ends when you're dead
Until then... give some back
```
This is a sample from the HBO Series [*Deadwood* by David Milch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood_(TV_series)), specifically this [scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8IfhmrlKho).
