# [](#header-1) Midterm Project Idea

I am working on my midterm with Lali, who had the wonderful idea of taking the search history of X number of people and comparing them to potentially find similar interests and form friendships. In its fullest form this would probably manifest itself as a website to which you would grant permission to your search history. After that it would compare your searches to a database and match you with someone with similar interests. We were not thinking of this as a couple matchmaking system (we both agreed that people with very similar interests rarely make good couples) but rather a place to find and build friendships. 

With all of this in mind, what we would do for the midterm would be to gather the search history from 6-8 friends of ours (including ourselves) and compare those. We would probably predispose matches to see if those data sets would match up the way we think they would. We would only compare the search data from the past year, probably, as things before that do not have nearly the significance as to who a person is now. 

[Go back](Philosophy-Of-Data).
