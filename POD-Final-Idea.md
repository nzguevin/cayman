# Final Project Idea

For my final project I was considering creating a twitter bot that would tweet out urban dictionary definitions for words. I found a json file that I could use to achieve this. I am not sure if this would be to simple of a project, though. If this would be too simple, maybe what I could do is write a web scraper to go along with it, and create the database myself. 

To be honest I have felt kind of lost for ideas. I would appreciate anything the class has to offer. I know that I want to work with a data set, but that is about all I know. I have been exploring data sets to find one that is interesting to me.
