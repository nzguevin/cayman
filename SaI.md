#Sophistry and Illusion

Background Sample: [Retrograde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XClvMMxBg1k) by James Blake and [Sandman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZN2-n_BIKI) by America

Title Reference: [An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Enquiry_Concerning_Human_Understanding) by Scottish philosopher [David Hume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume). The final quote of this volume is as follows:
>When we run over libraries, persuaded of these principles, what havoc must we make? If we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance; let us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.

[Verse 1 - Milo]

The wound is the place where the light enters
```
This is a quote by 13th-century poet [Rumi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumi).

```
So I stuck my right paw in an ice blender
I tend to ruin something nice and delicate
I've got the wingspan of several mighty pelicans
It seems like every asshole in the multi-verse
Has found their life's purpose in the multi-verse
So I got down on these ashy knees
And begged forgiveness for the same blasphemies
That I'd finger painted with pap smear yeast
And bloggers had called my masterpiece
But they couldn't pronounce it right
I'm feeling mad anxious, cranky and boneheaded
Home alone with some filthy animals and we're undressing
The subtext to a stressful lesson
Like I used to skip my string instrument sessions

Inhale deeply, thought I smelled the cedars of Lebanon
Mistook my notebook as Flowers For Algernon
```
[Flowers For Algernon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowers_for_Algernon) is a short story and novel by Daniel Keyes. This book is styled as a notebook following Charlie Gordon who is undergoing medication to cure a mental disease of his, thus there is a lot of progression in the writing. Milo is saying this is also the case with his lyric book. 

```
Dark storms, thunder and mad lightning
IPhone Notepad app don't look like my handwriting
I couldn't see you with my moon goggles
Now I run art rap, it's a boondoggle and it seems right
I think I'm Steve Reich
```
[Steve Reich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reich) was a pioneer of minimal music.

```
They called me Steve Urkel
```

```
But now I'm Prince Nelson, and my cloak's purple
```
[Prince Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)), or better known as simply Prince, was an American musician from Minnesota until he passed in 2016. 

```
I dare say you act funny
I'm drowning out your poopy rap songs with Thomas Pynchon audiobooks that I bought with rap moneys
```
[Thomas Pynchon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pynchon) is an American novelist who writes about history, music, science, and mathematics, all interests of Milo's.

```
Don't sound so surprised when
I tell you I'm Mr. Mojo Risin'
```

[Verse 2 - Nocando]

My heart shattered the shards in my shirt pocket
Knuckle all scarred from sparring inert objects
Shots in my collar and I call into work tardy
My counterpart called me to party in her body
Guest list, guess I won't stand in line
And she got a door man, what kind of man am I
Brass knuckles on the hands of time
Oh, baby, did they bust my lip, did they black my eye
Did they crush my dream, did they smash my pride
Did they change my trajectory, nah nah nah
See, I'm zen like the Dalai Lama
```
[Dalai Lama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama) is the title of the spiritual leaders of Tibet, who are often seen as being very calm and wise.

```
Ignite the marijuana magic wand and Cali ganja
If I tell a lie it's white than Obama's mama
As of late I've just been delighted with dodging drama
My nigga, my Nietzsche won't acknowledge karma
```
This is a reference to the philosophy of [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche), a German philosopher in the 19th century.

```
I'm feeling so sublime all the time
Rest in peace Brad
```
This is a reference to [Brad Nowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Nowell), the lead singer of Sublime until he passed away in 1996. 

```
Sleeping by yourself at night makes you feel like a sleazebag
Reading by yourself at night makes you write pretty deep raps
And these raps, make these pretty bitches pull out the knee pads
And pray to the god of Hellfyre, wherever the that fuck he's at
But Jimmy's here with a set of blood diamond tipped tweezers
Pulling blackhead magic out of Jimmy's beard
Watching these normal niggas behave pretty weird
Now I'm a normal nigga, and that's pretty weird
```
