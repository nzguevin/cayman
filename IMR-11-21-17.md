# Algorithmic Citizenship

I chose to write about this reading from the homework because it is the one that scared me the most. I find that the things that drive me in relationship to the Internet are those that scare me. Something that was established early on in the reading and was sort of glossed over was the idea that "Without citizenship, we have no rights at all." That really made me think. There are plenty of ways we can argue lack of citizenship. And those ways only expand with the idea of algorithmic citizenship. This is a slippery slope in my mind. If algorithmic citizenship gains more traction will it soon be necessary for everyone to have an online identity? It seems as though algorithmic citizenship already has plenty of traction, too.

The article talked about the roles that algorithmic citizenship already plays with the following: 

> "For example, the NSA is not allowed to spy on US citizens, so they use browsing data to assign a percentage score to everyone on the internet. If that score drops below 50% American, then they can record them: different laws apply to them, even if they don't know anything about them except how they behave online. "

This might be one of the most frightening pieces of information I have ever recieved. Is meerly using a VPN enough grounds for investigation? And what about lack of citizenship? Also this brings to light an incredibly important aspect of all of this; one may not know it is happening. A user could suddenly be subject to a whole new array of laws simply because of their Web use, and could not know about it the whole time. This brings up the question of consent with our Internet usage. Can one really consent to something without knowing the true meaning of that thing? The answer is no, however with the Internet the answer is often yes. This is incredibly worrisome and should be addressed in the near future.
